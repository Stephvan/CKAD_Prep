# Guide for Day_1

Day 1 had me doing basic pod config using the docker image from docker hub.

The docker image is a Flask python file.

To run the *Flask_Docker-master* as a docker image, you could either build using the dockerfile in */Day 1/Flask_Docker-master/deployments/app/* or use the docker compose file in the *Day 1/Flask_Docker-master/deployments/*
