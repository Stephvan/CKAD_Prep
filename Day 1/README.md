# Guide for Day_1

Day 1 had me doing basic pod config using the docker image from docker hub.

The docker image is a Flask python file.

To run the *Flask_Docker-master* as a docker image, you could either build using the dockerfile in */Day 1/Flask_Docker-master/deployments/app/* or use the docker compose file in the *Day 1/Flask_Docker-master/deployments/*


## Using the Dockerfile to build our image

To use the Dockerfile, change directory into the folder which contains the Dockerfile, then run:

```cmd
docker build -it image_name .
```
The "." in the command is to ensure it uses the folder as the context for the build. You can change to the right context if your dockerfile is located in another directory. Ensure you use the right relative path for the build context.

The *image_name* is the name you want to the image to name the image after the build.

## Using Docker compose:

To use docker compose, change to the directory where the docker-compose file is located and run the command:
```cmd
docker compose up
```

_N:B_ To run the image as a container, use the command:
```cmd
docker run --name any_name_for_the_container -it name_of_image
```

You need not worry about port setting as the web application is not set to a default port
